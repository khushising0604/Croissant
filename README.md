Hey there, This is my personal portfolio website I designed from scratch

It supports the following sections:
- Name and a short bio
- Education
- Experience
- Projects
- Skills
- Contact Info

Took me a while to build this but I'm open sourcing this for you to be able to use as you wish.

All content is completely editable out of the box from ```me.ts``` file.
